### Shared Services
Got it 👍 Since your repo `01SharedLibraryServices` is meant to be an **npm package** (a shared library), here’s a solid **README.md** template you can drop in and tweak as your project evolves:

---

# 01SharedLibraryServices

A **shared library of services and utilities** for Node.js/TypeScript projects. This package centralizes commonly used modules (helpers, API wrappers, middlewares, etc.) so they can be reused across multiple applications without duplication.

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @pandit-abhishek1/sharedservices

# Using yarn
yarn add @pandit-abhishek1/sharedservices

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @pandit-abhishek1/sharedservices
```

---

## 📦 Usage

Import and use the services in your project:

```ts
// Example: Import a helper
import { upload } from '@pandit-abhishek1/sharedservices';

async function main() {
  try {
    const result = await upload('./file.png', 'profile-pic');
    console.log('Uploaded:', result.secure_url);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Upload failed:', err);
  }
}
main();
```
